# Classic Code Snippets

### Classic Code Snippets is the new name for SC Display Code (sc-display-code) originally developed by Alan and Jack Coggins at Simply Computing (https://simplycomputing.com.au).

This plugin, created for [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/), is intended to be used for displaying code snippets on a page or post.

This is a **ClassicPress Research** plugin to find a workable alternative to using gist for displaying code snippets on a ClassicPress site.

The plugin uses highlight.js to provide syntax highlighting.

Code snippets saved or edited in the custom post type are also saved to a text file in wp-content/downloads/code with naming format: $post_id.txt

The raw view displays this file.
